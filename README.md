# Persistence Project

This program is just a small multiplication program. It takes any given number that has 2 digits or more and splits it into single digits.
The single digits are multiplied by each other to give another number. If the answer is another 2 digit number, it repeats the code
continuing to split until there is only a single digit left. 

Once there is a single digit left, the code outputs the amount of times
it ran the loop before it got to a single digit.
